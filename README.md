# MyJavascriptSketches
A repository holding all my browser sketches made with Javascript, HTML and the p5.js framework. 

## Seeing the code
To see the files that have been coded to create the sketches, simply open a named file and view the code within Github.

## Playing the code
If you wish to actually run the JavaScript sketch however, you must download the necessary files from the chosen folder and open the *index.html* file locally. 

## If some code doesn't work
If some sketches do not run, while in the browser press Ctrl+Shift+J and check the error message. Then check if you have downloaded all the necessary files from the sketch folder as some files may contain Object contructor functions needed for the main program to run.
